Meals On Wheels Routing Services


Executive Summary
	
	Key Advantages 
- More convenient delivery because it plans the route for you
- Improved relations between volunteers and recipients.

	Novelty
- Merging customer relations and route tracking for the sake of convenience

There are of course applications that already calculate your route and applications that manage your customers, but the former applications aren't integrated solutions and the latter tend to be far too heavyweight for our purposes. We're going to look to bring together these two things into one place to make it easier for the volunteers to do their job, while also improving the quality of service they can provide to recipients of Meals on Wheels.
